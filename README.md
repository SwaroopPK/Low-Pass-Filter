# Sallen Key Low-Pass-Filter

 This is a simple Sallen key circuit designed using KiCad. A SallenKey Low Pass Filter is a circuit which allows low frequency
 signals to pass through and blocks the higher frequency signal. The enclosed circuit is designed to obtain a cut-off frequency of 100KHz and the components aree chosen in order to obtain the required cut-off.
 
## Components Included:-

  * OpAmp:- AD8051
       ( *AD8051 datasheet for reference* [Datasheet_AD8051](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/AD8051_8052_8054.pdf) )
 
  * Resistors:- 2k and 110 ohm
  
  * Capacitors:- 2.2nF and 5.1nF
 
  * Battery:- 3V Ã—2 
 
   A library for AD8051 was manually created in KiCad.
 Also a footprint for AD8051(8 lead MSOP module) was created according to the datasheet.
 A PCB design was made and connections were made.

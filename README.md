# Sallen Key Low-Pass-Filter

 This is a simple Sallen key circuit designed using KiCad. A SallenKey Filter Low Pass Filter is a circuit which allows low frequency
 signals to pass through and blocks the higher frequency signal. The enclosed circuit is designed to obtain a cut-off frequency of 100KHz and the components aree chosen in order to obtain the required cut-off.
 
Components included:-

  1.OpAmp:- AD8051
 
  2.Resistors:- 2k and 110 ohm
  3.Capacitors:- 2.2nF and 5.1nF
 
  4.Battery:- 3V Ã—2 
 
   A library for AD8051 was manually created.
 Also a footprint for AD8051(8 lead MSOP module) was created according to the datasheet.
 A PCB design was made and connections were made
